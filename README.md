Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing
Mercedes-Benz world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system ,optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach,permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing.Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.

I reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench

If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero , i remove those variable(s).

Checked null and unique values for test and train sets.

Applied the label encoder with help of Sklearn library.

Performed dimensionality reduction.

Predicted test_df values using XGBoost with help of XFboost library.

This is a pictorial view for comparison between the target for training data-set and predicted target for testing data-set.
